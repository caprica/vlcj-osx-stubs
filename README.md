vlcj-osx-stubs
==============

This small library provides stub implementations of various OSX classes that can be used to cross-compile vlcj on Linux
and Windows.

These classes are used to implement the native full-screen strategy on OSX by using the Apple EAWT classes.

The library is only required at compile-time, and should ordinarily *not* be distributed with your application.
